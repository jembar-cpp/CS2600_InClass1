/** NumberGuessingGame.c
 * 
 * Program which allows the user to guess a number between 1 and 10 (or a different user-specified maximum)
 * 
 * TODO:
 * Implement function to printMenu() to print menu, prompt user input, and act based on input:
 *  - Press 1 to play a game
 *  - Press 2 to change the max number
 *  - Press 3 to quit
 * 
 * Implement function guessNumber(int answer) that loops, asking user to guess the number:
 *  - prints higher or lower based on number
 *  - if user wins, return to menu
 *  - if q is pressed, game ends (counts as loss) and returns to menu
 * 
 * On program end, display all games and how many guesses it took (or if they quit)
